For this hackathon problem statement, We are proposing a solution called SafeStride, an innovative safety app designed to help women quickly and discreetly alert others when they are in an unsafe situation. The key feature of SafeStride is its integration with the phone’s hardware, specifically the volume buttons, enabling a user to send out an emergency alert with a simple, covert press of the buttonn, by installing the app.

When a woman finds herself in an emergency or unsafe situation, she can simply press the volume button on her phone to trigger an immediate alert, without the need to unlock the phone or open the app, ensuring the process is discreet and quick. Upon activation, the phone emits a customizable beep sound, confirming that the emergency alert has been successfully sent. In addition to the sound, SafeStride will automatically share the user’s real-time location with pre-set emergency contacts via SMS or in-app notifications, ensuring they are notified of the situation immediately. Furthermore, the app will send a distress signal with the user’s location and a brief emergency message to the nearest police station or local emergency response center, helping authorities respond more swiftly. During installation, users will set up emergency contacts and configure the app to detect their preferred location, such as home or work, and send alerts accordingly. SafeStride runs in the background with minimal setup and requires no active interaction unless an emergency arises, making it an intuitive, always-ready safety solution![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f501b2ba-32af-4882-806c-c76a90788cac)
